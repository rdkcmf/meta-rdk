meta-rdk
==========

This is the location for the generic RDK components.

This layer is currently being developed, and is subject to drastic
changes anytime.

Setup
==========

This layer works with the Yocto Project release. The 'master' branch
tracks the in-progress Yocto Project release, and each supported
'stable' release is maintained in its own branch too.

This layer depends on:

Setup
==========

This layer includes configuration template files in meta-rdk/conf
folder. The easiest way to work with this layer, is to use the
associated repo manifest file, and the embedded setup script.

$ repo init https://<url>/<repository>/rdkmanifest -b daisy -g rdk
$ repo sync
$ source meta-rdk/setup-environment

The setup script will show the list of possible BSPs. It is
recommended to build each BSP in its own <build> folder, hence the
setup script will by default create a <build> folder called
'build-<machine>'.

You can install more BSP by simply adding the corresponding BSP layer
underneath the top-level folder (along with meta-rdk folder). The
setup script will search for possible machines using the following
command, executed from the top level folder:

$ ls -1 *{,/*}/conf/machine/*.conf
