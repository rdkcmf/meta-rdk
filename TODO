- improve setup-environment script so that BSP layer can be made of
  multiple layers, not just one. right now we are able to
  automagically find the BSP layer containing to the machine, but if
  the BSP layer in turns has dependencies we don't use them.
- improve setup-environment so that it does not depend on
  meta-rdk-comcast, the generic RDK should not know about any MSO
  upper layer s/w
- move away from SVN checkout, and use RDK Gerrit/Git instead
- add meta-linaro only for ARM platforms. meta-linaro is not properly
  designed, as soon as it's listed in bblayers.conf it will impact the
  build (eglibc, gcc, ..) even for non ARM platforms.
- better support for multiple architecture in rdk.conf. we have mostly
  worked with ARM SoC so far, rdk.conf needs some improvements to
  support non ARM equally
- DEFAULTTUNE is set in machine .conf right now. this is wrong, as
  DEFAULTUNE is a DISTRO setting. it should be set for each
  architecture in rdk.conf instead.
- migrate to OE core v1.6
